## Standards of Review

### De Novo Review
Applied to:
- Pure questions of law
- Constitutional issues
- Statutory interpretation
- Summary judgment rulings

**Standard:** No deference to trial court; appellate court decides the issue independently.

### Abuse of Discretion
Applied to:
- Discovery rulings
- Evidentiary rulings
- Sanctions
- Continuances
- New trial motions
- Attorney's fees determinations

**Standard:** Reversal only if the trial court's decision was "arbitrary, fanciful, or unreasonable" or "no reasonable person would agree." *Canakaris v. Canakaris*, 382 So. 2d 1197, 1203 (Fla. 1980).

### Competent Substantial Evidence
Applied to:
- Factual findings after non-jury trial
- Administrative agency decisions

**Standard:** Affirm if any competent substantial evidence supports the finding, even if other evidence supports a contrary finding. *Dept. of Highway Safety v. Critchfield*, 842 So. 2d 782 (Fla. 2003).

### Mixed Questions of Law and Fact
Applied to:
- Application of law to facts
- Contract interpretation (when extrinsic evidence used)

**Standard:** De novo for legal conclusions; deferential for underlying factual findings.

## Key Procedural Standards

### Motion to Dismiss (Rule 1.140(b)(6))

- *De Vaux v. Westwood Baptist Church*, 953 So. 2d 677 (Fla. 1st DCA 2007)

### Summary Judgment (Rule 1.510)

## Substantive Law Standards by DCA

**1st DCA:**
- *Acceleration Nat'l Serv. Corp. v. Brickell Fin. Servs. Motor Club*, 541 So. 2d 738 (Fla. 1st DCA 1989)

**Florida Supreme Court:**
- *Clay Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Johnson*, 873 So. 2d 1182 (Fla. 2003)
- *McCain v. Fla. Power Corp.*, 593 So. 2d 500 (Fla. 1992) (foreseeability as duty element)

### Fraud

**Standard:** Must be pled with particularity (Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.120(b)). Elements are questions of fact, but legal sufficiency of pleading is reviewed de novo.

**Key Cases:**
- *Lopez-Infante v. Union Cent. Life Ins. Co.*, 809 So. 2d 13 (Fla. 3d DCA 2002)
- *Johnson v. Davis*, 480 So. 2d 625 (Fla. 1985) (fraud in real estate transactions)

## Preservation of Error

### General Rule
To preserve an issue for appeal, a party must:
1. Make a timely and specific objection
2. State the legal ground for the objection
3. Obtain a ruling from the trial court

**Key Case:** *Castor v. State*, 365 So. 2d 701 (Fla. 1978)

### Exceptions (Fundamental Error)
The following may be raised for the first time on appeal:
- Lack of subject matter jurisdiction
- Constitutional errors affecting fundamental rights (rare in civil cases)
- Void judgments

### Motion for Directed Verdict / JMOL
Must be made at close of opposing party's evidence and renewed at close of all evidence to preserve sufficiency of evidence challenge.

### Post-Trial Motions
File motion for new trial or motion to alter/amend judgment within **15 days** to preserve certain issues.

## Inter-District Conflicts

When DCAs disagree on an issue, the Florida Supreme Court has discretionary jurisdiction to resolve the conflict. Fla. Const. art. V, § 3(b)(3).

**Practice Tip:** When no controlling authority exists in your DCA, cite persuasive authority from other DCAs but note any potential conflicts.

---

## Certified Questions

DCAs may certify questions of great public importance to the Florida Supreme Court. Fla. R. App. P. 9.030(a)(2)(A)(v).

**Practice Tip:** If your case involves a novel issue, consider requesting certification.
