2. Signed by the party against whom the claim is asserted
3. Specifies the period of tolling

### Continuing Violation Doctrine
For ongoing tortious conduct, each violation may restart the period.
*Note: Florida courts apply this narrowly.*

### Equitable Tolling
May apply when:
1. Defendant's conduct prevented timely filing
2. Plaintiff exercised due diligence

### Relation-Back for Amendments
Amended claims relate back to the original filing if they arise from the same transaction or occurrence. Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.190(c).

4. **Wrongful death separate period** (2 years from death, not injury)
5. **Construction repose** (10 years from completion)
6. **Products liability repose** (12-year useful safe life)
7. **Defamation single publication rule** (runs from first publication)
8. **UCC modification** (parties can reduce to 1 year)
