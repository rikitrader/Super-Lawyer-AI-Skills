## Why Banking/Foreclosure is "Bizarre but Real"

Banking litigation generates unusual filings because:

1. **Document-Driven:** Cases hinge on chain of title, assignments, endorsements
2. **Standing Issues:** Who owns the note? Who can enforce?
3. **Business Records:** Servicer records require proper foundation
4. **Lost Note Problems:** Original note often missing; affidavits required
5. **Accounting Disputes:** Payment histories, escrow, suspense accounts
6. **Florida-Specific:** Rule 1.115 verified complaints; § 702 requirements
