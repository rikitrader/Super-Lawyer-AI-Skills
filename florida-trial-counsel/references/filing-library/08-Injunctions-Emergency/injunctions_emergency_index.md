## Emergency Relief Framework

```
EMERGENCY RELIEF HIERARCHY:
1. Ex Parte TRO → Immediate, without notice (rare)
2. TRO with Notice → Short notice, limited duration
3. Preliminary Injunction → Hearing required, pending trial
4. Permanent Injunction → After trial on merits
```

### Four-Part Test (Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.610)
1. Substantial likelihood of success on merits
2. Irreparable harm without injunction
3. Threatened harm outweighs opponent's harm
4. Injunction serves public interest
