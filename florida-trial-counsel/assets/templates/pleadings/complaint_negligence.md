## Special Considerations

### Comparative Fault
Florida follows pure comparative negligence. Plaintiff's recovery reduced by percentage of fault. Fla. Stat. § 768.81.

### Punitive Damages
**Do NOT plead initially.** Fla. Stat. § 768.72 requires court permission to amend to add punitive damages after proffer showing reasonable basis.

### Sovereign Immunity
If defendant is government entity, verify waiver under Fla. Stat. § 768.28 and comply with notice requirements.

### Wrongful Death
If death resulted, action must be brought under Florida Wrongful Death Act, Fla. Stat. §§ 768.16-768.26.
