                       GENERAL DENIAL

        Except as expressly admitted herein, Defendant denies each and every
allegation of the Complaint, including any allegation not specifically addressed.

                      AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES

        Without waiving any denials or defenses stated above, and without
assuming any burden of proof that would otherwise rest with Plaintiff, Defendant
asserts the following affirmative defenses:

                    FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                    (Failure to State a Claim)

        Plaintiff's Complaint fails to state a cause of action upon which relief
can be granted. [Specify which claim(s) and why, if known.]

                   SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                    (Statute of Limitations)

        Plaintiff's claims are barred, in whole or in part, by the applicable
statute of limitations, including but not limited to Florida Statutes
§ 95.11[(__)(__)]. [Specify:] Plaintiff's cause of action accrued on or before
{{DATE}}, more than [__] years before this action was filed.

                    THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                       (Statute of Frauds)

        Plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of frauds, Florida Statutes
§ 725.01, because the alleged agreement [was not in writing / was not signed by
Defendant / concerned real property / could not be performed within one year].

                   FOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                    (Lack of Consideration)

        The alleged contract is unenforceable for lack of consideration.

                    FIFTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                   (Failure of Consideration)

        The alleged contract is unenforceable due to failure of consideration,
as Plaintiff failed to [perform / provide the consideration alleged].

                    SIXTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                   (Material Breach by Plaintiff)

        Plaintiff is not entitled to recover because Plaintiff materially
breached the [Contract / Agreement] first by [describe Plaintiff's breach].

                   SEVENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                    (Conditions Precedent)

        Plaintiff has failed to satisfy conditions precedent to recovery,
including [identify specific conditions precedent].

                   EIGHTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                           (Waiver)

        Plaintiff's claims are barred by waiver. Plaintiff waived the rights
now asserted by [describe conduct constituting waiver].

                    NINTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                          (Estoppel)

        Plaintiff is estopped from asserting the claims alleged because
Plaintiff [describe conduct giving rise to estoppel] and Defendant relied on
such conduct to Defendant's detriment.

                    TENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                           (Laches)

        Plaintiff's claims are barred by laches. Plaintiff unreasonably delayed
in asserting the claims, and Defendant has been prejudiced by such delay.

                   ELEVENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                       (Unclean Hands)

        Plaintiff's claims are barred by the doctrine of unclean hands.
Plaintiff's own inequitable conduct relating to the subject matter of this
action precludes recovery.

                   TWELFTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                    (Comparative Negligence)
              [FOR NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS ONLY]

        Plaintiff's damages, if any, were caused in whole or in part by
Plaintiff's own negligence, and any recovery must be reduced in proportion to
Plaintiff's comparative fault pursuant to Florida Statutes § 768.81.

                  THIRTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                    (Assumption of Risk)
              [FOR NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS ONLY]

        Plaintiff assumed the risk of the alleged injuries by knowingly and
voluntarily exposing [himself/herself/itself] to the danger.

                  FOURTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                    (Acts of Third Parties)

        Plaintiff's damages, if any, were caused by the acts or omissions of
third parties over whom Defendant had no control.

                  FIFTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                     (Failure to Mitigate)

        Plaintiff failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages, and any
recovery must be reduced accordingly.

                  SIXTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                    (Economic Loss Rule)
                [FOR TORT CLAIMS WITH CONTRACT]

        Plaintiff's tort claims are barred by Florida's economic loss rule, as
any duties allegedly owed by Defendant arose solely from contract.

                  SEVENTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                         (Release)

        Plaintiff's claims are barred by a release executed by Plaintiff on or
about {{DATE}}.

                  EIGHTEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                    (Accord and Satisfaction)

previously agreed to settle the dispute on {{DATE}}, and that agreement has been
satisfied.

                  NINETEENTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                     (Payment / Setoff)

        Defendant is entitled to setoff against any amounts owed to Plaintiff
for [amounts owed by Plaintiff to Defendant / payments already made].

                  TWENTIETH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
                    (Reservation of Defenses)

        Defendant reserves the right to assert additional affirmative defenses
as they become known through discovery or otherwise.

                          COUNTERCLAIM
              [OPTIONAL - Include if Defendant has claims against Plaintiff]
