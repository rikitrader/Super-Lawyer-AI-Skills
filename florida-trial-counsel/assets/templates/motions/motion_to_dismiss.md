              DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS COMPLAINT

        Defendant, {{DEFENDANT_NAME}}, by and through undersigned counsel,
pursuant to Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.140(b), moves to dismiss
Plaintiff's Complaint and states:

                              INTRODUCTION

        1.      This Motion is filed pursuant to Florida Rule of Civil Procedure
1.140(b)(6), which permits dismissal when a complaint fails to state a cause of
action upon which relief can be granted.

        [OR SELECT APPROPRIATE GROUND(S):]

        [ ] Rule 1.140(b)(1) - Lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter
        [ ] Rule 1.140(b)(2) - Lack of jurisdiction over the person
        [ ] Rule 1.140(b)(3) - Improper venue
        [ ] Rule 1.140(b)(4) - Insufficiency of process
        [ ] Rule 1.140(b)(5) - Insufficiency of service of process
        [ ] Rule 1.140(b)(6) - Failure to state a cause of action
        [ ] Rule 1.140(b)(7) - Failure to join an indispensable party

                              STANDARD OF REVIEW

        2.      On a motion to dismiss, the court must accept the factual
allegations of the complaint as true and must view those allegations in the
light most favorable to the plaintiff. Siegle v. Progressive Consumers Ins. Co.,
819 So. 2d 732, 734 (Fla. 2002).

        3.      However, a court need not accept legal conclusions couched as
factual allegations. Ginsberg v. Lennar Fla. Holdings, Inc., 645 So. 2d 490,
495 (Fla. 3d DCA 1994).

        4.      A complaint must allege sufficient "ultimate facts" to state a
cause of action. Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.110(b). Conclusory allegations and legal
conclusions are insufficient. De Vaux v. Westwood Baptist Church, 953 So. 2d
677, 680 (Fla. 1st DCA 2007).

                              STATEMENT OF FACTS

        5.      Plaintiff filed its Complaint on {{FILING_DATE}}, alleging
[briefly summarize the nature of the claims].

        6.      [State relevant procedural facts, if any.]

                              ARGUMENT

                              I.
              [GROUND 1: FAILURE TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION]
        THE COMPLAINT FAILS TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION FOR [CLAIM TYPE]

        7.      To state a claim for [breach of contract / negligence / fraud /
etc.], a plaintiff must allege:

                [FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT:]
                a.      A valid contract;
                b.      A material breach of the contract; and
                c.      Damages resulting from the breach.

                Friedman v. New York Life Ins. Co., 985 So. 2d 56, 58 (Fla. 4th
                DCA 2008).

                [FOR NEGLIGENCE:]
                a.      A duty owed by defendant to plaintiff;
                b.      Breach of that duty;
                c.      Proximate causation; and
                d.      Damages.

                Clay Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Johnson, 873 So. 2d 1182, 1185 (Fla.
                2003).

                [FOR FRAUD:]
                a.      A false statement of material fact;
                b.      The maker knew or should have known the statement was
                        false;
                c.      The maker intended the statement to induce reliance;
                d.      The plaintiff relied on the statement; and
                e.      The plaintiff was damaged as a result.

                Lopez-Infante v. Union Cent. Life Ins. Co., 809 So. 2d 13, 15
                (Fla. 3d DCA 2002).

        8.      Plaintiff's Complaint is deficient because [identify specific
deficiency]:

                a.      [First deficiency - explain with specificity why the
                        complaint fails to allege required element]

                b.      [Second deficiency - continue as needed]

        9.      [For fraud claims specifically:]

        Plaintiff's fraud claim must be dismissed because fraud must be pled
with particularity. Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.120(b). Plaintiff fails to allege
[specifically what the misrepresentation was / when it was made / who made it /
how it was false].

        10.     [For written contract claims specifically:]

        Plaintiff's breach of contract claim must be dismissed because Plaintiff
failed to attach the written instrument upon which the claim is founded, as
required by Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.130(a), and failed to explain why
the instrument cannot be attached.

                              II.
              [GROUND 2: IF APPLICABLE - LACK OF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION]

        11.     This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because [explain -
e.g., amount in controversy is below circuit court threshold / matter is within
exclusive jurisdiction of another court].

                              III.
              [GROUND 3: IF APPLICABLE - IMPROPER VENUE]

        12.     Venue is improper in {{COUNTY}} County because [none of the
defendants reside here / the cause of action did not accrue here / the property
is not located here]. See Fla. Stat. § 47.011.

                              IV.
              [GROUND 4: IF APPLICABLE - STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS]

        13.     Plaintiff's claim is barred by the applicable statute of
limitations. [Identify the claim and the applicable limitation period under Fla.
Stat. Ch. 95.]

        14.     The Complaint on its face establishes that Plaintiff's cause of
action accrued on {{ACCRUAL_DATE}}, more than [4/5/etc.] years before this
action was filed on {{FILING_DATE}}.

        15.     When the statute of limitations defense is apparent on the face
of the complaint, dismissal is proper. Major League Baseball v. Morsani, 790 So.
2d 1071, 1074 (Fla. 2001).

                              CONCLUSION

        WHEREFORE, Defendant, {{DEFENDANT_NAME}}, respectfully requests that
this Court:

        A.      Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint with prejudice [or without
prejudice if amendment might cure];

        B.      Award Defendant its costs and attorney's fees [if statutory or
contractual basis];

        C.      Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and
proper.

                                        Respectfully submitted,

                                        {{FIRM_NAME}}
