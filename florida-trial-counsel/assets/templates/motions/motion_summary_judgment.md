        [PLAINTIFF'S/DEFENDANT'S] MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

        [Plaintiff/Defendant], {{MOVANT_NAME}}, pursuant to Florida Rule of Civil
Procedure 1.510, moves for summary judgment [on all claims / on Count ___] and
states:

                              INTRODUCTION

        1.      This Motion for Summary Judgment is filed pursuant to Florida
Rule of Civil Procedure 1.510. Summary judgment is appropriate because there is
no genuine dispute as to any material fact, and [Plaintiff/Defendant] is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

                              SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD

        2.      A court shall grant summary judgment "if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, affidavits, and other
materials as would be admissible in evidence on file show that there is no
genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a
judgment as a matter of law." Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.510(c); Volusia County v. Aberdeen
at Ormond Beach, L.P., 760 So. 2d 126, 130 (Fla. 2000).

        3.      Florida has adopted the federal summary judgment standard as
articulated in Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 (1986), and Adickes v.
S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144 (1970). See In re Amendments to Fla. R. Civ. P.
1.510, 309 So. 3d 192 (Fla. 2020).

        4.      The movant bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence
of a genuine issue of material fact. If the movant meets this burden, the burden
shifts to the nonmoving party to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for
trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323-24.

        5.      A genuine dispute exists when "the evidence is such that a
reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson v.
Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).

                              STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED MATERIAL FACTS

        The following material facts are undisputed:

        2.      [Continue for each material fact]

                              LEGAL ARGUMENT

                              I.
        [MOVANT] IS ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON [COUNT/CLAIM] BECAUSE
                    [LEGAL BASIS]

        6.      [State the elements of the claim or defense at issue]

                [FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT:]
                To prevail on a breach of contract claim, a plaintiff must prove:
                (1) a valid contract; (2) a material breach; and (3) damages.
                Beck v. Lazard Freres & Co., 175 F.3d 913, 914 (11th Cir. 1999)
                (applying Florida law); Friedman v. New York Life Ins. Co., 985
                So. 2d 56, 58 (Fla. 4th DCA 2008).

                [FOR NEGLIGENCE:]
                To prevail on a negligence claim, a plaintiff must prove: (1) a
                duty of care owed by defendant to plaintiff; (2) breach of that
                duty; (3) proximate causation; and (4) damages. Clay Elec. Coop.,
                Inc. v. Johnson, 873 So. 2d 1182, 1185 (Fla. 2003).

        7.      [Apply the undisputed facts to the legal elements]

                A.      [First Element]

                The undisputed facts establish [element]. Specifically,
                [explanation with citations to Statement of Undisputed Facts
                paragraph numbers].

                B.      [Second Element]

                The undisputed facts establish [element]. [Continue analysis]

                C.      [Continue for each element]

        8.      Because the undisputed facts establish each element of
[Plaintiff's/Defendant's] claim [or negate an essential element of the opposing
party's claim], [Movant] is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.

                              II.
        [ALTERNATIVE GROUND, IF APPLICABLE]

        9.      [If arguing in the alternative, state the alternative basis for
summary judgment]

                              III.
        [OPPOSING PARTY CANNOT ESTABLISH GENUINE DISPUTE]
                    [Include if anticipating opposition]

        10.     The nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is
some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v.
Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986).

        11.     "[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the
parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary
judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact."
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986) (emphasis in
original).

        12.     [Address any expected arguments from the opposing party]

                              CONCLUSION

        WHEREFORE, [Plaintiff/Defendant], {{MOVANT_NAME}}, respectfully requests
that this Court:

        A.      Grant this Motion for Summary Judgment;

        B.      Enter final judgment in favor of [Plaintiff/Defendant]

        D.      Award [Plaintiff/Defendant] pre-judgment interest, costs, and
                attorney's fees [if applicable and identify legal basis];

        E.      Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and
                proper.

                                        Respectfully submitted,
