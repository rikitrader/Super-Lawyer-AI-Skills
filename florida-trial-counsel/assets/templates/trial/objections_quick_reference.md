"Your Honor, may we approach?"
```

```
"Your Honor, for the record, I would like to make an offer of proof."
```

Include:
1. What the evidence would have been
2. Why it's admissible
3. Why it's relevant

---

## Motion to Strike

```
"Move to strike and instruct the jury to disregard."
```

---

## Continuing Objection

When same objection applies to line of questioning:

```
"Your Honor, may I have a continuing objection to this line of questioning?"
```

If granted, no need to repeat for each question.

---

## Quick Hearsay Analysis

```
1. Is it a "statement"? (Oral, written, or nonverbal assertion)
   → If no assertion, not hearsay

2. Is it "out of court"?
   → If made in this proceeding while testifying, not hearsay

3. Is it offered for the "truth of the matter asserted"?
   → If offered for other purpose, not hearsay

4. Does an exception apply?
   → Check § 90.803 (availability immaterial)
   → Check § 90.804 (unavailability required)
   → Check § 90.801(2) (not hearsay by definition)
```
