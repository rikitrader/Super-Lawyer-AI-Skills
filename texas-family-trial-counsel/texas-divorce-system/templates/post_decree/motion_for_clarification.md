## CLARIFICATION STANDARDS

**TFC § 157.421 - Motion to Clarify:**
- Order must be ambiguous on its face
- Clarification makes order specific enough to enforce by contempt
- Cannot substantially change the order
- Does not extend enforcement period

**TFC § 157.423 - Clarifying Order:**
Court may render clarifying order that:
- Explains meaning of order
- Specifies times, manner, conditions
- Does not substantively change original order

**When to Seek Clarification:**
- Before or with enforcement motion
- When order terms unclear
- When parties dispute meaning
- When contempt would fail due to ambiguity

THE MARRIAGE OF                     §
                                    §

                    MOTION TO CLARIFY ORDER

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:

     {{CLIENT_NAME}}, Movant, files this Motion to Clarify pursuant to
Texas Family Code § 157.421 and would respectfully show the Court as
follows:

                         I. PARTIES

     1.1  Movant is {{CLIENT_NAME}}, who resides at {{CLIENT_ADDRESS}}.

     1.2  Respondent is {{OTHER_PARTY}}, who may be served at
{{OTHER_ADDRESS}}.

                      II. JURISDICTION

     2.1  This Court has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over this
matter pursuant to Texas Family Code Chapter 155.

                   III. ORDER TO BE CLARIFIED

     3.1  The order to be clarified is the [Final Decree of Divorce /
Order in Suit Affecting Parent-Child Relationship / Order on Motion to
Modify] signed on {{ORDER_DATE}}.

     3.2  A true and correct copy of the order is attached as Exhibit "A."

                    IV. AMBIGUOUS PROVISIONS

     4.1  The order contains provisions that are ambiguous and require
clarification to be enforceable. Specifically:

     AMBIGUITY 1:
     The order states:

          "[QUOTE EXACT LANGUAGE FROM ORDER]"

     This language is ambiguous because:

          [EXPLAIN WHY AMBIGUOUS - e.g., does not specify time, location,
          manner, which party, which child, etc.]

     The parties dispute the meaning as follows:

          Movant's interpretation: [Describe]

          Respondent's interpretation: [Describe]

     Clarification is needed to specify:

          [What clarification is needed]


     AMBIGUITY 2:
     The order states:

          "[QUOTE EXACT LANGUAGE FROM ORDER]"

     This language is ambiguous because:

          [EXPLAIN AMBIGUITY]

     Clarification is needed to specify:

          [What clarification is needed]


     [Continue for each ambiguous provision]

            V. REQUESTED CLARIFICATIONS

     5.1  Movant requests that the Court clarify the order as follows:

     CLARIFICATION 1:
     The provision regarding [topic] should be clarified to provide:

          "[PROPOSED CLARIFIED LANGUAGE]"

     This clarification does not substantively change the original order;
     it merely makes the order specific enough to be enforceable.

     CLARIFICATION 2:
     The provision regarding [topic] should be clarified to provide:

          "[PROPOSED CLARIFIED LANGUAGE]"

     [Continue for each proposed clarification]

              VI. NECESSITY FOR CLARIFICATION

     6.1  Clarification is necessary because:

          ☐ The ambiguous provisions cannot be enforced by contempt
          without clarification.

          ☐ The parties have disputed the meaning of the provisions.

          ☐ Movant seeks to enforce the order and clarification is a
          prerequisite.

          ☐ The ambiguity has caused confusion regarding the parties'
          obligations.

              VII. ENFORCEMENT REQUEST (IF APPLICABLE)

     [Include if combining with enforcement motion]

     7.1  Movant also seeks enforcement of the order as clarified.
     Following clarification, Movant requests that the Court proceed
     to enforcement as alleged in Movant's Motion for Enforcement
     filed contemporaneously herewith [or: as follows - describe
     violations].

                   VIII. ATTORNEY'S FEES

     8.1  Movant requests that the Court order Respondent to pay
reasonable attorney's fees and costs pursuant to Texas Family Code
§ 106.002.

                       IX. PRAYER

     WHEREFORE, Movant respectfully prays that the Court:

     1.   Set this matter for hearing;

     2.   Clarify the order as requested above;

     3.   Enter a clarifying order that specifies the times, manner,
          and conditions of performance sufficient to allow enforcement
          by contempt;

     4.   [If enforcement requested:] Enforce the order as clarified;

     5.   Award Movant reasonable attorney's fees and costs;

     6.   Grant such other and further relief to which Movant may be
          entitled.

                              Respectfully submitted,

                              {{FIRM_NAME}}


                              By: _____________________________

## CLARIFICATION VS. MODIFICATION

| Clarification | Modification |
|---------------|--------------|
| Makes existing order specific | Changes the order |
| Same rights, clearer terms | Different rights |
| No change in circumstances needed | Requires changed circumstances |
| Interprets original intent | Creates new terms |
| Can be filed anytime | May have time limits |

**Key Test:** Does the proposed change give a party something they didn't have before? If yes → modification. If no → clarification.

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Prior order attached
- [ ] Ambiguous provisions quoted exactly
- [ ] Ambiguity clearly explained
- [ ] Proposed clarification specific
- [ ] Does not substantively change order
- [ ] Verification signed
- [ ] Service arranged

## Risk Flags

- [ ] Proposed clarification is actually a modification

- [ ] Other party will argue different interpretation
- [ ] May need to proceed to modification instead

*For attorney use. Clarification preserves original order - does not change it.*
