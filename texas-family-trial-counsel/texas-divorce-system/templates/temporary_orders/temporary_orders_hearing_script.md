### V. CLOSING ARGUMENT

```
"Your Honor, the evidence shows that:

1. CONSERVATORSHIP: [Client] has been the primary caregiver for
   these children. [He/She] gets them ready for school, takes them
   to school, picks them up, helps with homework, and attends their
   activities. Stability requires that this continue.

2. CHILD SUPPORT: [Spouse]'s income is $[Amount]. Guideline support
   for [X] children is [X]%, which equals $[Amount] per month. This
   is appropriate and necessary.

3. [SPOUSAL SUPPORT]: [Client]'s income of $[Amount] is insufficient
   to meet [his/her] reasonable expenses of $[Amount]. [Spouse] has
   the ability to pay $[Amount] per month pending trial.

4. [RESIDENCE]: The children have lived in the marital residence
   for [X] years. Their stability requires that they remain there
   with [Client].

[Client] respectfully requests that the Court enter temporary orders
as outlined in our proposed order.

Thank you, Your Honor."
