## ABOUT STANDING ORDERS

**What Are Standing Orders?**
Standing orders are automatic court orders that take effect when a divorce is filed (for Petitioner) or upon service (for Respondent). They remain in effect until the court modifies them or the case concludes.

**Authority:** Local rules vary by county. Harris County uses Standing Order (Local Rule 6.6).

**Enforcement:** Violation may result in contempt, sanctions, adverse inference at trial, or loss of credibility.
