THE ORDER, INCLUDING CONTEMPT OF COURT. A FINDING OF CONTEMPT MAY BE
PUNISHED BY CONFINEMENT IN JAIL FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS, A FINE OF UP TO
$500 FOR EACH VIOLATION, AND A MONEY JUDGMENT FOR PAYMENT OF
ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COURT COSTS.

     FAILURE OF A PARTY TO MAKE A CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENT TO THE PLACE
AND IN THE MANNER REQUIRED BY A COURT ORDER MAY RESULT IN THE PARTY
NOT RECEIVING CREDIT FOR MAKING THE PAYMENT.

     FAILURE OF A PARTY TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT DOES NOT JUSTIFY DENYING
THAT PARTY COURT-ORDERED POSSESSION OF OR ACCESS TO A CHILD. REFUSAL
BY A PARTY TO ALLOW POSSESSION OF OR ACCESS TO A CHILD DOES NOT
JUSTIFY FAILURE TO PAY COURT-ORDERED CHILD SUPPORT TO THAT PARTY.
