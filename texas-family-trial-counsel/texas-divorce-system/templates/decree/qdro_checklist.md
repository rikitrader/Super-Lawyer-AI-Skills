## QDRO OVERVIEW

**What is a QDRO?**
A Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) is a court order that directs a retirement plan to pay benefits to an alternate payee (typically a former spouse). It must meet specific federal ERISA requirements.

**Why Needed?**
Without a QDRO, retirement plans cannot divide benefits between divorcing spouses. The decree alone is insufficient.

**Timeline:**
| Step | When | Responsible |
|------|------|-------------|
| Identify plans | During discovery | Attorney |
| Draft QDRO terms for decree | Before trial/MSA | Attorney |
| Obtain plan model/requirements | Before drafting QDRO | Attorney |
| Draft QDRO | Within 30-90 days of decree | Attorney/QDRO specialist |
| Submit for plan pre-approval | Before court filing | Attorney |
| File with court | After plan approval | Attorney |
| Serve on plan | After court signature | Attorney |
