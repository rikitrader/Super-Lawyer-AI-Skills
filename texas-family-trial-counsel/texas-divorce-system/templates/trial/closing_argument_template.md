Court to [summary of relief].

```

---

## II. CONSERVATORSHIP

### A. Legal Standard

```
Your Honor, the governing standard for conservatorship is the best
interest of the child. Texas Family Code Section 153.002.

The Court must consider the best interest factors, and there is a
presumption that appointment of joint managing conservators is in
the children's best interest. TFC § 153.131.

[Or if sole managing sought]

That presumption may be rebutted when the evidence shows [grounds].
```

### B. Apply Evidence to Best Interest Factors

```
Looking at the best interest factors:

**Factor 1: Desires of the child**
[Evidence showed...]

[If applicable]
```

1. Appoint the parties as joint managing conservators
2. Give [Client] the exclusive right to designate primary residence
   within [geographic restriction]
3. [Other specific conservatorship orders]
```

---

## III. POSSESSION AND ACCESS

### A. Legal Standard

```
The standard possession order is presumed to be in the best interest
of the child. TFC § 153.252.

[Or if modified schedule requested]

The Court may deviate from the standard possession order when the
evidence establishes that a different schedule is in the child's
best interest.
```

### B. Apply Evidence

```

### C. Specific Request

## IV. CHILD SUPPORT

### A. Legal Standard

Chapter 154. For [one/two/three] child(ren), the guideline is

[percentage split].
```

## V. PROPERTY DIVISION

### A. Legal Standard

```
Texas Family Code Section 7.001 requires the Court to divide the
marital estate in a manner that is just and right, having due regard
for the rights of each party.

This does not require an equal division, but a fair division
considering all circumstances.
```

```
