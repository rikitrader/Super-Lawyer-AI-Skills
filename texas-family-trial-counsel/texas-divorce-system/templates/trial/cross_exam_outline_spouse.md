## CROSS-EXAMINATION PRINCIPLES

**Goals of Cross:**
1. Get admissions favorable to your case
2. Impeach credibility
3. Establish facts supporting your theory
4. Minimize damage from direct

**Rules:**
- Lead with leading questions
- Control the witness
- Ask only questions you know the answer to
- Don't argue - get the answer and move on
- Short questions, simple answers
- Don't let witness explain
- End strong

**Structure Each Topic:**
1. Set up (non-threatening questions)
2. Key question (the point you're making)
3. Stop (don't give witness chance to explain)
