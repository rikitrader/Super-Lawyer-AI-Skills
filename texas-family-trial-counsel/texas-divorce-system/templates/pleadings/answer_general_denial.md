                     ORIGINAL ANSWER - GENERAL DENIAL

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:

     COMES NOW, {{RESPONDENT_NAME}}, Respondent in the above-styled
and numbered cause, and files this Original Answer in response to
Petitioner's Original Petition for Divorce, and would respectfully
show the Court as follows:

                         I. DISCOVERY CONTROL PLAN

     1.01 Discovery in this case is intended to be conducted under
Level 2 of Rule 190 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.

                           II. GENERAL DENIAL

     2.01 Pursuant to Rule 92 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure,
Respondent generally denies each and every allegation contained in
Petitioner's Original Petition for Divorce and demands strict proof
thereof.

                         III. AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES

[INCLUDE IF APPLICABLE - DELETE IF NOT NEEDED:]

     3.01 Respondent reserves the right to assert affirmative
defenses after discovery in this matter.

[ALTERNATIVE - SPECIFIC AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES:]
[
     3.01 Condonation. Petitioner condoned any conduct that forms
the basis for this suit and is therefore barred from relief based
upon such conduct.

     3.02 Recrimination. Petitioner's own conduct precludes
Petitioner from obtaining relief in this cause.
]

                              IV. PRAYER

     WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Respondent prays that:

     1. Petitioner take nothing by this suit;

     2. Respondent be awarded all relief to which Respondent is
     justly entitled;

     3. All costs of this suit be taxed against Petitioner; and

     4. For such other and further relief, in law or in equity,
     to which Respondent may be justly entitled.

                              Respectfully submitted,

                              {{FIRM_NAME}}
