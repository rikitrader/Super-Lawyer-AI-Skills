TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:

     {{RESPONDENT_NAME}}, Counter-Petitioner, files this Counter-
Petition for Divorce against {{PETITIONER_NAME}}, Counter-Respondent,
and in the interest of the child(ren) of the marriage, and would

                         I. DISCOVERY CONTROL PLAN

     1.01 Discovery in this case is intended to be conducted under

appeared in this cause and may be served through counsel of record
at the address shown below.

     2.02 Counter-Respondent, {{PETITIONER_NAME}}, has previously

                    III. DOMICILE AND RESIDENCE

preceding six-month period and a resident of {{COUNTY}} County for

     3.02 Alternatively, this Court has jurisdiction over the subject
matter and parties as {{PETITIONER_NAME}} has invoked the jurisdiction
of this Court by filing the Original Petition for Divorce.

                    IV. PROTECTIVE ORDER STATEMENT

     4.01 No protective order under Title 4 of the Texas Family Code
or under Chapter 7A of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure is in
effect in regard to a party to this suit or a child of a party to
this suit.

[ALTERNATIVE IF PROTECTIVE ORDER EXISTS:]
[     4.01 A protective order is currently in effect as previously
stated in Petitioner's Original Petition.]

                           V. MARRIAGE

     5.01 Counter-Petitioner and Counter-Respondent were married on
or about {{MARRIAGE_DATE}}.

     5.02 Counter-Petitioner and Counter-Respondent ceased to live
together as spouses on or about {{SEPARATION_DATE}}.

                    VI. GROUNDS FOR DIVORCE

     6.01 The marriage has become insupportable because of discord
or conflict of personalities between Counter-Petitioner and Counter-
Respondent that destroys the legitimate ends of the marital
relationship and prevents any reasonable expectation of reconciliation.

[ADDITIONAL GROUNDS IF APPLICABLE:]
[
     6.02 Counter-Respondent is guilty of cruel treatment toward
Counter-Petitioner of a nature that renders further living together
insupportable.

     6.03 Counter-Respondent committed adultery.
]

                    VII. CHILDREN OF THE MARRIAGE

     7.01 Counter-Petitioner and Counter-Respondent are the parents
of the following child(ren):

     Name: {{CHILD_1_NAME}}
     Sex: {{CHILD_1_SEX}}
     Birth Date: {{CHILD_1_DOB}}
     Home State: Texas
     Current Residence: {{CHILD_1_RESIDENCE}}

     [Name: {{CHILD_2_NAME}}
     Sex: {{CHILD_2_SEX}}
     Birth Date: {{CHILD_2_DOB}}
     Home State: Texas
     Current Residence: {{CHILD_2_RESIDENCE}}]

     7.02 Counter-Petitioner adopts and incorporates by reference
the allegations regarding children set forth in Petitioner's Original
Petition to the extent not inconsistent with this Counter-Petition.

                        VIII. CONSERVATORSHIP

     8.01 It is in the best interest of the child(ren) that Counter-
Petitioner and Counter-Respondent be appointed Joint Managing
Conservators of the child(ren).

     8.02 Counter-Petitioner should be appointed as the conservator
who has the exclusive right to designate the primary residence of
the child(ren) within {{COUNTY}} County, Texas, and contiguous
counties.

[ALTERNATIVE - SOLE MANAGING CONSERVATOR:]
[     8.02 Counter-Petitioner should be appointed Sole Managing
Conservator of the child(ren), and Counter-Respondent should be
appointed Possessory Conservator, because it is in the best interest
of the child(ren) and:

     a. The parties do not have a history of sharing the rights
     and duties of raising the child(ren); and/or

     b. The parties cannot communicate sufficiently to allow joint
     decision-making; and/or

     c. Awarding joint managing conservatorship would impair the
     physical health or emotional development of the child(ren).]

                    IX. POSSESSION AND ACCESS

     9.01 It is in the best interest of the child(ren) that possession
of and access to the child(ren) be as set forth in the Standard
Possession Order in sections 153.311 through 153.317 of the Texas
Family Code.

[ALTERNATIVE - EXPANDED SPO:]
[     9.01 It is in the best interest of the child(ren) that possession
of and access to the child(ren) be as set forth in the Expanded
Standard Possession Order.]

[ALTERNATIVE - MODIFIED/RESTRICTED:]
[     9.01 It is in the best interest of the child(ren) that Counter-
Respondent's possession of and access to the child(ren) be supervised
because [state reasons].]

                       X. CHILD SUPPORT

     10.01 Counter-Petitioner requests that Counter-Respondent be
ordered to pay child support for the child(ren) in accordance with
the guidelines set forth in Chapter 154 of the Texas Family Code.

     10.02 Counter-Petitioner requests that child support be paid
through income withholding in accordance with Chapter 158 of the
Texas Family Code.

     10.03 Counter-Petitioner requests that Counter-Respondent be
ordered to provide medical support and dental support for the
child(ren) by:

          a. Maintaining health insurance for the child(ren); and/or

          b. Paying additional amounts of cash medical support.

     10.04 Counter-Petitioner requests that the parties be ordered
to share unreimbursed health-care expenses for the child(ren).

                    XI. COMMUNITY PROPERTY

     11.01 Counter-Petitioner and Counter-Respondent have accumulated
community property during their marriage, which the Court should
divide in a manner that the Court deems just and right, as provided
by law.

     11.02 Counter-Petitioner requests a disproportionate division
of the community estate in Counter-Petitioner's favor due to:

          a. The disparity in earning capacities of the parties;

          b. The fault of Counter-Respondent in the breakup of
          the marriage;

          c. The nature of the property;

          d. [Other factors as applicable].

                    XII. SEPARATE PROPERTY

     12.01 Counter-Petitioner requests that Counter-Petitioner's
separate property be confirmed to Counter-Petitioner.

     12.02 Counter-Petitioner's separate property includes:

          a. [List separate property items]

                    XIII. SPOUSAL MAINTENANCE

[IF REQUESTING:]
     13.01 Counter-Petitioner requests the Court to order Counter-
Respondent to pay spousal maintenance to Counter-Petitioner because:

          a. Counter-Petitioner clearly lacks sufficient property,
          including property to be distributed to Counter-Petitioner
          in this divorce, to provide for Counter-Petitioner's
          minimum reasonable needs; and

          b. [SELECT APPLICABLE:]
             [ ] The parties have been married for ten years or
             longer and Counter-Petitioner lacks the ability to
             earn sufficient income; or
             [ ] Counter-Respondent has committed family violence
             against Counter-Petitioner within two years of filing
             or during the pendency of this suit; or
             [ ] Counter-Petitioner has an incapacitating physical
             or mental disability; or
             [ ] A child of the marriage has a physical or mental
             disability that requires substantial care.

[IF OPPOSING:]
     13.01 Counter-Respondent should not be awarded spousal
maintenance because Counter-Respondent does not meet the statutory
requirements and/or has adequate resources to provide for Counter-
Respondent's needs.

                    XIV. CHANGE OF NAME

[IF REQUESTING:]
     14.01 Counter-Petitioner requests that Counter-Petitioner's
name be changed to {{FORMER_NAME}}.

[IF NOT REQUESTING:]
     14.01 Counter-Petitioner does not request a change of name.

                      XV. ATTORNEY'S FEES

     15.01 Counter-Petitioner requests the Court to order Counter-
Respondent to pay reasonable attorney's fees, expenses, and costs
incurred by Counter-Petitioner in this proceeding.

                          XVI. PRAYER

     WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Counter-Petitioner prays that:

     1. The Court grant a divorce and dissolve the marriage between
     the parties;

     2. The Court divide the community estate in a just and right
     manner, with a disproportionate share awarded to Counter-
     Petitioner;

                              Respectfully submitted,
