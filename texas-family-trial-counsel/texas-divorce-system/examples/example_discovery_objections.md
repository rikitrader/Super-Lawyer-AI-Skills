## Expected Response

### Response to Interrogatory No. 15

**OBJECTION.** Respondent objects to this interrogatory on the following grounds:

1. **Attorney-Client Privilege (TRE 503).** To the extent this interrogatory seeks information about communications between Respondent and her attorneys, such information is protected by the attorney-client privilege and is not discoverable.

2. **Work Product Doctrine (TRCP 192.5).** To the extent this interrogatory seeks information about communications made in anticipation of litigation or for trial preparation, such information is protected work product.

3. **Overly Broad and Unduly Burdensome.** This interrogatory is overly broad and unduly burdensome in that it seeks "every conversation" with "any person" without any reasonable limitation as to subject matter or time period. The interrogatory as drafted would require Respondent to describe thousands of conversations, the vast majority of which have no relevance to any issue in this case.

4. **Not Reasonably Calculated to Lead to Discoverable Evidence.** Casual conversations with friends, family members, and acquaintances about the fact of the divorce have no bearing on the issues of property division, conservatorship, or support.

**Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Respondent states:**

Respondent has communicated with the following categories of persons regarding this lawsuit: (1) her attorneys; (2) immediate family members including her mother, Patricia Williams, and her sister, Jennifer Williams; (3) her therapist, Dr. Sarah Chen. Respondent declines to describe the substance of privileged communications. Non-privileged communications with family members generally involved informing them of the status of the case and seeking emotional support.

### Response to Interrogatory No. 16

**OBJECTION.** Respondent objects to this interrogatory on the following grounds:

1. **Overly Broad as to Time Period.** The ten-year time period requested far exceeds the duration of the marriage and is not reasonably calculated to lead to discoverable evidence. The parties were married on June 15, 2020, and financial accounts predating the marriage by many years are not relevant to the division of the community estate.

2. **Unduly Burdensome.** Requiring Respondent to research and document accounts that may have been opened and closed over a decade-long period, many of which have no bearing on this case, is unduly burdensome.

3. **Already Disclosed.** Respondent's current financial accounts were disclosed in Respondent's Initial Disclosures served on [DATE] pursuant to TRCP 194.

**Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Respondent states:**

Respondent will supplement her Initial Disclosures to identify all bank accounts, investment accounts, and retirement accounts in which she has had any interest **during the marriage** (June 15, 2020 to present). As of the date of this response, those accounts include:

1. Chase Checking Account ending in 4521 - Current balance: $3,245.67
2. Chase Savings Account ending in 7832 - Current balance: $12,456.00
3. Fidelity 401(k) through current employer - Current balance: $45,678.90
4. Fidelity IRA - Current balance: $8,234.56

Account statements for the above accounts have been produced in response to Petitioner's Requests for Production.

### Response to Interrogatory No. 17

**OBJECTION.** Respondent objects to this interrogatory on the following grounds:

1. **Overly Broad and Unduly Burdensome.** This interrogatory seeks "all" communications with "any member of the opposite sex" over a multi-year period. Such a request would encompass thousands of routine, non-relevant communications with male coworkers, family members, service providers, and others, the identification and review of which would be extraordinarily burdensome.

2. **Not Reasonably Calculated to Lead to Discoverable Evidence.** The vast majority of communications with members of the opposite sex (work emails, texts with male relatives, communications with service providers, etc.) have no relevance to any issue in this case.

3. **Harassment.** The breadth of this request suggests it is designed to harass rather than to obtain relevant information.

4. **Privacy.** This interrogatory invades Respondent's reasonable expectation of privacy in routine, non-relevant communications.

**Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Respondent states:**

Respondent is not aware of any text messages, emails, or social media communications during the marriage that would be relevant to any issue of property division, conservatorship, or support in this case. Respondent denies any inappropriate relationship during the marriage.

To the extent Petitioner has a good-faith basis to believe specific communications are relevant, Petitioner should identify those communications with reasonable particularity.

### Response to Interrogatory No. 18

**OBJECTION.** Respondent objects to this interrogatory on the following grounds:

1. **Overly Broad.** The phrase "any facts relevant to this case" is so broad as to be meaningless. This could include witnesses to the marriage ceremony, witnesses to every purchase of community property, every teacher, doctor, and service provider who has interacted with the parties or children, and countless others.

2. **Contention Interrogatory.** To the extent this interrogatory seeks identification of witnesses Respondent may call at trial, it is premature prior to the close of discovery.

3. **Duplicative.** Witnesses with knowledge of relevant facts have been or will be identified in Respondent's Initial Disclosures, witness lists, and other discovery responses.

**Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Respondent states:**

Persons with knowledge of facts relevant to this case include:

1. The parties, {{PETITIONER_NAME}} and {{RESPONDENT_NAME}}
2. [Family members with relevant knowledge]
3. [Children's teachers/doctors if custody is at issue]
4. [Experts retained or to be retained]

Respondent reserves the right to supplement this response as discovery continues and to designate additional witnesses as permitted by the Court's scheduling order.

### Response to Interrogatory No. 19

**RESPONSE.** John Davis is a coworker of Respondent at [Employer]. Respondent met Mr. Davis approximately two years ago when he joined the company. Their relationship is professional. They work in the same department and interact during regular business hours regarding work matters. Respondent has attended work-related events where Mr. Davis was also present, including company meetings, team lunches, and a company holiday party.

Respondent denies any romantic or inappropriate relationship with Mr. Davis.
