## Texas Mediation Framework

**Key Principles:**
- Confidential process
- Voluntary settlement (can't be forced)
- Mediator is neutral facilitator
- Parties control outcome
- MSA is binding once signed

**Binding Effect (Texas Family Code):**
A Mediated Settlement Agreement (MSA) in a family law case is binding if it:
- States prominently that it is not subject to revocation
- Is signed by both parties
- Is signed by both attorneys (if represented)

Once signed, an MSA is enforceable as a contract and the court must render judgment on the MSA terms (with limited exceptions).

### Step 4: Conduct Mediation

- [ ] Remind client: patience required

*During Session:*

- Receive and evaluate opposing offers
- Counter-propose
- Identify areas of movement
- Protect confidential information shared with mediator

**Negotiation Strategy:**
```
DO:
✓ Make reasonable opening offer
✓ Move incrementally
✓ Justify each position with facts
✓ Listen to mediator's assessment
✓ Consider creative solutions
✓ Take breaks when needed
✓ Keep client focused on goals

DON'T:
✗ Make extreme opening demands
✗ Insult opposing party
✗ Refuse to move at all
✗ Let emotions drive decisions
✗ Make decisions under pressure
✗ Agree to unclear terms
```

### Step 5: Document Settlement (if reached)

**Mediated Settlement Agreement (MSA) Requirements:**

*Required Language:*
```
THIS AGREEMENT IS NOT SUBJECT TO REVOCATION.
```

*Required Signatures:*
- [ ] Petitioner signature
- [ ] Respondent signature

- [ ] Date

*MSA Content:*

- [ ] Possession and access terms
- [ ] Child support terms
- [ ] Medical/dental support terms
- [ ] Spousal maintenance terms (if any)
- [ ] Attorney's fees terms

**CRITICAL: Review Before Signing**
```
Before client signs MSA:
1. Read entire document aloud
2. Ensure client understands EVERY term
3. Clarify any ambiguous language
4. Confirm math is correct
5. Verify all issues addressed
6. Explain binding effect one more time
7. Obtain client's affirmative consent
```

### Step 6: Partial Settlement

**If Only Some Issues Resolved:**
- [ ] Document resolved issues in writing
- [ ] Have parties sign partial agreement
- [ ] Identify remaining contested issues
- [ ] Set remaining issues for trial

**Rule 11 Agreement Option:**
- Less formal than MSA
- Must be in writing
- Filed with court
- Signed by parties and attorneys
- Enforceable as contract

### Step 7: Impasse Procedures

**If No Settlement Reached:**
- [ ] Document impasse
- [ ] Identify narrowed issues
- [ ] Consider future mediation
- [ ] Proceed to trial preparation
- [ ] Preserve information learned for trial strategy

**Post-Mediation Options:**

- Direct settlement negotiations
- Proceed to trial
- Partial settlement + trial on remaining

## Evidence Checklist (Bring to Mediation)

**Essential Documents:**
