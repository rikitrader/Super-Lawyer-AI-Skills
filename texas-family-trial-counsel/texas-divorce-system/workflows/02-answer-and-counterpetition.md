## Deadline Calculation

```
ANSWER DUE DATE CALCULATION:

1. Identify service date
2. Add 20 days (exclude service date, include last day)
3. Find the first Monday at or after day 20
4. That Monday is the answer deadline

Example:
Service Date: Wednesday, January 15, 2026
+20 days: Tuesday, February 4, 2026
First Monday at/after: Monday, February 10, 2026 = ANSWER DUE

IMPORTANT: If the Monday is a legal holiday, answer is due the next day
that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
```

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Review Petition and Calculate Deadline

**Upon Receipt of Petition:**
- [ ] Note service date precisely
- [ ] Calculate answer deadline
- [ ] Calendar answer deadline with reminders
- [ ] Review all allegations in petition
- [ ] Identify jurisdictional issues
- [ ] Identify factual disputes
- [ ] Assess counterclaim opportunities

**Petition Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Correct parties named
- [ ] Jurisdiction properly alleged
- [ ] Venue proper
- [ ] Grounds for divorce stated
- [ ] Children properly identified (if applicable)
- [ ] Property allegations accurate
- [ ] Relief requested identified

### Step 2: Determine Response Strategy

**Decision Branch - Response Type:**
```
IF uncontested_agreed:
    → File Waiver of Service (if not yet served)
    → Or file General Denial and proceed to settlement
    → Coordinate with opposing counsel

IF contested_dispute_facts:
    → File verified answer with specific denials
    → Assert affirmative defenses
    → File counterpetition with own claims

IF jurisdictional_defect:
    → File Special Exceptions
    → Challenge jurisdiction/venue before answering merits
    → File Motion to Transfer Venue if needed

IF procedural_defect:
    → File Special Exceptions to petition
    → Request more definite statement
    → Preserve objections
```

### Step 3: Prepare General Denial

**Texas General Denial:**
A general denial puts in issue all material allegations and requires Petitioner to prove their case. This is the most common answer form.

**General Denial Components:**
- [ ] Caption matching petition
- [ ] General denial statement
- [ ] Prayer (request court deny Petitioner's relief)
- [ ] Signature block
- [ ] Certificate of service

**Standard General Denial Language:**
```
Respondent generally denies each and every allegation
contained in Petitioner's Original Petition for Divorce
and demands strict proof thereof.
```

### Step 4: Add Specific Denials (if needed)

**When to Use Specific Denials:**
- Certain facts admitted, others disputed
- Strategic admission of uncontested facts
- Preserve specific objections

**Specific Denial Format:**
```
Respondent specifically denies:
1. [Specific allegation denied]
2. [Specific allegation denied]

Respondent admits:
1. [Specific allegation admitted]
```

### Step 5: Assert Affirmative Defenses

**Common Affirmative Defenses in Divorce:**

| Defense | Applicability |
|---------|---------------|
| Condonation | Petitioner forgave alleged fault |
| Recrimination | Petitioner also at fault |
| Connivance | Petitioner facilitated misconduct |
| Collusion | Parties manufactured grounds |
| Limitations | Abandonment >1 year before filing |
| Res judicata | Prior adjudication of issues |

**Affirmative Defense Format:**
```
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES

1. Condonation: Petitioner condoned the conduct alleged
   by [specific facts showing forgiveness].

2. [Additional defenses as applicable]
```

### Step 6: Prepare Counterpetition

**When to File Counterpetition:**
- Respondent wants divorce granted on own terms
- Different grounds for divorce preferred
- Different relief requested than Petitioner seeks
- Strategic positioning for trial

**Counterpetition Components:**
- [ ] Caption (same cause number)
- [ ] Title: "Counter-Petition for Divorce"
- [ ] Jurisdictional allegations
- [ ] Grounds for divorce
- [ ] Children allegations (if applicable)
- [ ] Property allegations
- [ ] Specific relief requested
- [ ] Prayer
- [ ] Verification (if required)

**Counterpetition Relief Options:**
- [ ] Divorce granted to Respondent
- [ ] Specific property division
- [ ] Conservatorship terms
- [ ] Child support
- [ ] Spousal maintenance
- [ ] Attorney's fees
- [ ] Name change

### Step 7: Special Exceptions (if applicable)

**Grounds for Special Exceptions:**
- Petition fails to state cause of action
- Allegations too vague or indefinite
- Jurisdictional defects apparent
- Improper joinder of claims

**Special Exception Format:**
```
SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS

Respondent specially excepts to Petitioner's Original
Petition for Divorce on the following grounds:

1. Paragraph [X] fails to state [specific defect]
2. [Additional exceptions]

WHEREFORE, Respondent requests the Court sustain
these special exceptions and require Petitioner to
amend to cure the defects.
```

### Step 8: Motion to Transfer Venue (if applicable)

**Grounds for Venue Challenge:**
- Neither party resides in county
- Mandatory venue applies elsewhere
- Permissive venue more appropriate

**Venue Motion Requirements:**
- [ ] File with or before answer
- [ ] State grounds for transfer
- [ ] Identify proper county
- [ ] Request hearing

### Step 9: File Response

**E-Filing Process:**
- [ ] Access e-filing system
- [ ] Select existing cause number
- [ ] Upload answer document
- [ ] Upload counterpetition (if any)
- [ ] Upload special exceptions (if any)
- [ ] Submit filing
- [ ] Obtain file-stamped copies
- [ ] Serve opposing party/counsel

**Certificate of Service:**
- [ ] Include certificate on all filings
- [ ] Serve by authorized method
- [ ] Email service if counsel of record

### Step 10: Handle Opposing Answer (if representing Petitioner)

**When Respondent Files Answer:**
- [ ] Review answer for admissions
- [ ] Note any affirmative defenses
- [ ] Review counterpetition allegations
- [ ] Calculate response deadline to counterpetition
- [ ] Assess impact on case strategy

**Response to Counterpetition:**
- File answer to counterpetition
- Same deadline rules apply (Monday after 20 days)
- General denial typically sufficient

## Evidence Checklist

**Preserve and Document:**
- [ ] Petition as served (with service date)
- [ ] Answer as filed
- [ ] Counterpetition as filed
- [ ] Proof of service on opposing party
- [ ] Any special exceptions or motions
- [ ] Deadline calculations documented

## Risk Flags

| Risk | Indicator | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Missed deadline | Answer date passed | File immediately, may need leave |
| Default risk | No answer on file | Oppose default motion, show good cause |
| Venue waived | Answer without venue challenge | Venue objection lost if not timely raised |
| Admissions made | Poorly drafted answer | Review all language carefully |
| Counterclaims missed | Failed to assert own claims | May file later but prejudice possible |
