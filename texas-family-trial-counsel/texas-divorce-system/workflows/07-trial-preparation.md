## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Trial Calendar and Checklist

**Critical Dates:**
- [ ] Trial date: {{TRIAL_DATE}}
- [ ] Pretrial conference: {{PRETRIAL_DATE}}
- [ ] Exhibit/witness exchange deadline: {{EXCHANGE_DATE}}
- [ ] Motions in limine deadline: {{LIMINE_DATE}}
- [ ] Expert designation deadline: {{EXPERT_DATE}}
- [ ] Discovery cutoff: {{DISCOVERY_CUTOFF}}

**Master Preparation Checklist:**
- [ ] Finalize theory of case
- [ ] Organize all exhibits
- [ ] Prepare exhibit list
- [ ] Prepare witness list
- [ ] Draft direct examinations
- [ ] Draft cross-examinations
- [ ] Draft opening statement
- [ ] Draft closing argument
- [ ] Prepare motions in limine
- [ ] Prepare proposed findings/orders
- [ ] Witness preparation sessions
- [ ] Create trial notebook
- [ ] Subpoena witnesses
- [ ] Confirm expert availability

### Step 2: Finalize Theory of Case

**Theory of Case Statement:**
```
A compelling, one-paragraph narrative that:
- Explains what happened
- Why client should prevail
- Incorporates key evidence
- Appeals to fairness and equity
- Guides all trial decisions
```

**Example Theory (Custody):**
```
{{CLIENT_NAME}} has been the primary caregiver for these
children throughout the marriage, managing their education,
healthcare, and daily needs while {{SPOUSE_NAME}} focused
on career and traveled frequently. The children's stability
and best interest require continuing this arrangement, with
{{CLIENT_NAME}} as the parent who determines primary residence.
```

**Example Theory (Property):**
```
During this marriage, {{CLIENT_NAME}} contributed equally
to building the community estate while also sacrificing
career advancement to support {{SPOUSE_NAME}}'s business.
A just and right division requires recognizing these
contributions and the disparity in earning capacity.
```

### Step 3: Organize Exhibits

**Exhibit Organization System:**

*Exhibit Numbering:*
```
Petitioner's Exhibits: P-1, P-2, P-3...
Respondent's Exhibits: R-1, R-2, R-3...

OR (Joint numbering by agreement):
Joint Exhibits: J-1, J-2, J-3...
```

*Exhibit Categories:*
```
FINANCIAL (F):
P-1 through P-20: Tax returns, pay stubs, statements

PROPERTY (P):
P-21 through P-40: Deeds, titles, appraisals

CHILDREN (C):
P-41 through P-60: School records, medical records

COMMUNICATIONS (M):
P-61 through P-80: Texts, emails, messages

EXPERT (E):
P-81 through P-90: Expert reports, valuations
```

**Exhibit Preparation:**
- [ ] Each exhibit numbered and tabbed
- [ ] Multiple copies (judge, witness, opposing counsel, file)
- [ ] Authentication method identified for each
- [ ] Admissibility basis noted
- [ ] Anticipated objections noted

### Step 4: Prepare Witness List

**Witness Categories:**

*Fact Witnesses:*
- Client (Petitioner/Respondent)

### Step 6: Draft Cross-Examinations

## Courtroom Notes

- Organization is credibility—disorganized presentation hurts case
- Know your exhibits cold—fumbling undermines confidence
- Practice opening and closing out loud
- Anticipate objections and have responses ready
- Keep direct examinations focused—don't overreach
- Cross-examination: less is more—get key admissions and sit down
- Have proposed orders ready to hand judge at conclusion
- Bring everything—you can't go get it during trial
