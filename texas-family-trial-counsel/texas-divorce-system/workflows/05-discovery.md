## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Develop Discovery Plan

**Assess Case Needs:**
```
PROPERTY ISSUES:
□ Real property valuation
□ Business valuation
□ Retirement account tracing
□ Separate property claims
□ Hidden assets suspected
□ Dissipation claims

CUSTODY ISSUES:
□ Parenting fitness
□ Historical involvement
□ Safety concerns
□ Third-party witnesses
□ Professional evaluations

SUPPORT ISSUES:
□ Income verification
□ Earning capacity
□ Special expenses
□ Needs assessment
```

**Discovery Strategy Matrix:**

| Issue | Discovery Tool | Target |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| Basic facts | Disclosure | Opposing party |
| Detailed facts | Interrogatories | Opposing party |
| Documents | Production requests | Opposing party |
| Third-party records | Subpoena | Banks, employers, etc. |
| Testimony | Deposition | Opposing party, witnesses |
| Admissions | RFAs | Opposing party |

### Step 2: Request for Disclosure

**Mandatory Disclosure Topics (TRCP 194.2):**
- [ ] Correct names of parties
- [ ] Contact information
- [ ] Legal theories and factual bases
- [ ] Amount of damages
- [ ] Name/address/phone of persons with knowledge
- [ ] Testifying expert information
- [ ] Relevant documents and tangible things
- [ ] Relevant indemnity and insurance

**Service:**
- [ ] Prepare Request for Disclosure
- [ ] Serve on opposing party
- [ ] Response due: 30 days

### Step 3: Prepare Interrogatories

**Interrogatory Limits:**
- Level 2: 25 interrogatories (including subparts)
- Family law often permits more by agreement

**Standard Family Law Interrogatories:**

*Identity and Background:*
```
1. State your full legal name, all aliases, date of birth,
   Social Security number, and driver's license number.

2. State your current employer, position, and work address.
```

*Financial Information:*
```
3. Identify all bank accounts in which you have or have had
   an interest during the marriage, including account numbers,
   financial institutions, and current balances.

4. Identify all retirement accounts, pension plans, or
   deferred compensation in which you have an interest.

5. State your gross monthly income from all sources.
```

*Property Information:*
```
6. Identify all real property in which you have an interest,
   including address, acquisition date, and current value.

7. Identify all vehicles titled in your name or that you drive.
```

*Children (if applicable):*
```
8. Describe your typical weekly schedule with the children.

9. Identify all persons who provide childcare for the children.
```

### Step 4: Prepare Requests for Production

**Standard Production Categories:**

*Financial Documents:*
- [ ] Tax returns (3-5 years)
- [ ] Pay stubs (12 months)
- [ ] W-2s and 1099s
- [ ] Bank statements (all accounts, 3 years)
- [ ] Credit card statements (3 years)
- [ ] Retirement account statements
- [ ] Investment account statements
- [ ] Loan documents

*Property Documents:*
- [ ] Deeds and titles
- [ ] Purchase contracts
- [ ] Appraisals
- [ ] Insurance policies
- [ ] Business records (if applicable)

*Communication Documents:*
- [ ] Text messages (relevant)
- [ ] Emails (relevant)
- [ ] Social media posts (relevant)

*Children-Related Documents:*
- [ ] School records
- [ ] Medical records
- [ ] Activity schedules
- [ ] Childcare records

### Step 5: Prepare Requests for Admission

**Effective RFA Use:**
- Establish undisputed facts
- Pin down dates and amounts
- Authenticate documents
- Narrow issues for trial

**Sample RFAs:**

```
1. Admit that the residence located at [address] was
   purchased during the marriage.

2. Admit that Exhibit A attached hereto is a true and
   correct copy of your 2025 federal tax return.

3. Admit that you earned gross income of $[amount]
   in calendar year 2025.

4. Admit that you have a retirement account with
   [company] with a current balance of approximately
   $[amount].
```

**RFA Response Consequences:**
- No response in 30 days = Deemed admitted
- Deemed admissions are conclusive
- Can be used at trial without further proof

### Step 6: Issue Subpoenas

**Third-Party Subpoenas Common in Family Law:**

| Target | Records Sought |
|--------|---------------|
| Employer | Employment records, pay history |
| Bank | Account statements, transactions |
| Brokerage | Investment records |
| Retirement plan | Account statements, beneficiary info |
| Cell phone carrier | Call/text records, location data |
| School | Attendance, grades, contacts |
| Medical providers | Treatment records |
| Therapist/counselor | Treatment records (privilege issues) |

**Subpoena Requirements:**
- [ ] Issue from court clerk
- [ ] Proper notice to parties (TRCP 205)
- [ ] Serve on custodian of records
- [ ] Include witness fee and mileage (if personal appearance)
- [ ] Allow reasonable time for compliance

**HIPAA Considerations:**
- Medical records require authorization or
- Qualified Protective Order

### Step 7: Notice Depositions

**Deposition Strategy:**

*Opposing Party Deposition:*
- [ ] Notice with reasonable time
- [ ] Include document requests
- [ ] Prepare examination outline
- [ ] Focus on key issues
- [ ] Lock in testimony

*Third-Party Depositions:*
- [ ] Expert witnesses
- [ ] Fact witnesses
- [ ] Character witnesses (custody)
- [ ] Financial witnesses

**Deposition Notice Requirements:**
- [ ] Name of deponent
- [ ] Date, time, and location
- [ ] If documents requested, specify (duces tecum)
- [ ] Reasonable notice (typically 10+ days)

### Step 8: Respond to Opposing Discovery

**Response Timeline:**
- 30 days from service to respond
- Extensions by agreement (document in writing)
- Court may modify

**Response Components:**

*For Interrogatories:*
- [ ] Answer each interrogatory
- [ ] Object with specificity if appropriate
- [ ] Verify responses under oath

*For Production Requests:*
- [ ] Respond to each request
- [ ] Produce or object
- [ ] Privilege log for withheld documents

*For Admissions:*
- [ ] Admit, deny, or qualified response
- [ ] Respond within 30 days or deemed admitted

**Objection Grounds:**
- Overly broad
- Unduly burdensome
- Privilege (attorney-client, work product)
- Not reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence
- Harassment
- Beyond scope of discovery

### Step 9: Supplementation

**Supplementation Duty (TRCP 193.5):**
- Supplement when new information learned
- Before trial
- For all discovery responses
- Failure to supplement = exclusion possible

**Track Supplementation:**
- [ ] Log original responses
- [ ] Monitor for new information
- [ ] Prepare supplemental responses as needed
- [ ] Serve supplements timely

### Step 10: Discovery Disputes

**Motion to Compel:**
```
IF opposing_party_fails_to_respond:
    OR opposing_party_response_inadequate:

1. Confer with opposing counsel (required)
2. Document conference in writing
3. File Motion to Compel
4. Request sanctions if appropriate
5. Set for hearing
```

**Motion for Protective Order:**
```
IF discovery_request_improper:
    OR discovery_harassment:

1. Confer with opposing counsel
2. File Motion for Protective Order
3. Specify protection sought
4. Set for hearing
```

## Courtroom Notes

- Discovery responses are sworn—inconsistencies are powerful impeachment
- Document requests should be specific enough to be enforceable
- Preserve all meta-data on electronic evidence
- Third-party records are often more reliable than party productions
- RFA deemed admissions are devastating if missed
- Deposition testimony locks witnesses into positions
- Discovery disputes can signal case weakness to judges
