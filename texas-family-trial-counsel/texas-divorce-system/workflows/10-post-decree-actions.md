SPECIAL WARRANTY DEED

[Grantor name], Grantor, for and in consideration of
the division of property in that certain Final Decree
of Divorce in Cause No. {{CAUSE_NO}}, in the {{COURT}}
of {{COUNTY}} County, Texas, hereby conveys to [Grantee
name], Grantee, the following described property...

[Legal description]

Grantor binds Grantor and Grantor's heirs, executors,
and administrators to warrant and forever defend all
and singular the said premises unto the said Grantee
against every person whomsoever lawfully claiming or
to claim the same or any part thereof, by, through,
or under Grantor, but not otherwise.
```

**Mortgage Considerations:**
```
WARNING: Deed transfer does NOT release mortgage liability

IF mortgage exists:
- Deed transfers ownership
- Original borrower remains liable
- Options:
  a. Refinance in receiving spouse's name
  b. Assumption (if lender allows)
  c. Sale of property
  d. Accept continued liability (risky)

Decree should address mortgage responsibility.
```

| Application for Title | Request new title |
| Copy of decree | Basis for transfer |
| Release of lien (if applicable) | Clear encumbrance |

**If Vehicle Has Loan:**
```
Option 1: Refinance

**Important Note on Debt:**
```
CREDITOR NOT BOUND BY DECREE

for joint debts regardless of decree terms.

Protection options:
- Refinance into one spouse's name

```

### Step 8: Name Change (if applicable)

- [ ] Passport
- [ ] Banks and financial institutions
- [ ] Credit cards
- [ ] Employer
- [ ] Professional licenses
- [ ] Voter registration

### Step 9: Documentation and Verification

**Completion Verification:**
- [ ] All transfers confirmed
- [ ] Documentation filed
- [ ] Client has certified decree copies
- [ ] Outstanding issues identified

**File Documentation:**
| Transfer | Date Completed | Confirmation |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| QDRO 1 | | |
| QDRO 2 | | |
